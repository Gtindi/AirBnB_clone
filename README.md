# The Alx AIRBnB CLONE                                                                                                         
## Description
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

## the HBNB console                                                                                                   
----
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

   -Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)  
   -Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…  
   -Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)  
   -Update attributes of an object  
   -Destroy an object  
   
## Commands and how to use it                                                                                     
the command interpreter allow us to handle our data requirements with the following commands
